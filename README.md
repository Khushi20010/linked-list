# Linked List Programs in C++

This repository contains various implementations and operations on **Singly Linked Lists** in C++.  
Each program is written for learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, especially for placement preparation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **Insert Operations**
  - Insert at the beginning
  - Insert at the end
  - Insert at a specific position

- **Delete Operations**
  - Delete from beginning
  - Delete from end
  - Delete from a specific position

- **Search & Count**
  - Search for an element
  - Count the number of nodes

- **Traversal**
  - Display list
  - Print list in reverse (recursion)

- **Other Operations**
  - Find middle node (Slow & Fast pointer)
  - Find Nth node from the end
  - Reverse linked list (Iterative & Recursive)
  - Check if linked list is a palindrome

## ðŸ›  Compilation & Execution

To compile and run any program:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
g++ Findnthnode.cpp -o Findnthnode
./Findnthnode

Do you want me to also **add this README to your repo and push it** so it appears immediately on GitHub? That way, your repo will look clean and professional.
