# Linked List Programs in C++

This repository contains various implementations and operations on **Linked Lists** in C++.  
Each program is written for learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, especially for placement preparation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **Insert Operations**
  - Insert at the beginning
  - Insert at the end
  - Insert at a specific position

- **Delete Operations**
  - Delete from beginning
  - Delete from end
  - Delete from a specific position

- **Search & Count**
  - Search for an element
  - Count the number of nodes

- **Traversal**
  - Display list
  - Print list in reverse (recursion)

- **Other Operations**
  - Find middle node (Slow & Fast pointer)
  - Find Nth node from the end
  - Reverse linked list (Iterative & Recursive)
  - Check if linked list is a palindrome
  - # Linked List Programs in C++



## âœ… Programs Included

1. **Palindrome.cpp**  
   Check whether a linked list is a palindrome.

2. **ReverseIterative.cpp**  
   Reverse a linked list using an iterative method.

3. **DetectLoop.cpp**  
   Detect if a linked list contains a loop (cycle).

4. **RemoveLoop.cpp**  
   Remove a loop in a linked list if present.

5. *(Add any other linked list programs here)*
