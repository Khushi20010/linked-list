# Linked List Programs in C++

This repository contains various implementations and operations on **Linked Lists** in C++.  
Each program is written for learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, especially for placement preparation.

## 📂 Contents

- **Insert Operations**
  - Insert at the beginning
  - Insert at the end
  - Insert at a specific position

- **Delete Operations**
  - Delete from beginning
  - Delete from end
  - Delete from a specific position

- **Search & Count**
  - Search for an element
  - Count the number of nodes

- **Traversal**
  - Display list
  - Print list in reverse (recursion)

- **Other Operations**
  - Find middle node (Slow & Fast pointer)
  - Find Nth node from the end
  - Reverse linked list (Iterative & Recursive)
  - Check if linked list is a palindrome
  - # Linked List Programs in C++
# Linked List Implementations in C++

This repository contains various implementations and problems related to **Linked Lists** in C++.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Creation of a Linked List
- Insertion at beginning, end, and given position
- Deletion from beginning, end, and given position
- Traversal and Display
- Merging Two Sorted Linked Lists (Iterative & Recursive)
- Intersection of Two Linked Lists
- Rotation of Linked List by K positions

## 🚀 Files in Repository
- `MergeTwoSortedLinkedList.cpp` → Merge two sorted linked lists (iterative & recursive)
- `IntersectionOfLL.cpp` → Find intersection point of two linked lists
- `rotationBYK.cpp` → Rotate linked list by K positions
- Other helper files and executables
